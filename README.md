🧾 Project Overview

The Multi‑User To‑Do Manager is a console-based task management system developed in C language, designed to help multiple users collaboratively organize and manage tasks efficiently. The project allows users to create tasks, assign them to team members, set priorities and deadlines, track completion status, and generate productivity reports. It demonstrates major programming concepts such as structures, dynamic memory allocation, modular functions, data sorting, searching, string manipulation, and menu-driven interface design.

This system simulates real‑world task management software, enabling users to work in groups like professional development teams. The application helps improve workflow structuring, supports multi‑user collaboration, and provides tools to visualize performance and task progress.

🎯 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop an interactive task management system that:

Allows multiple users to collaboratively manage assigned tasks

Automates sorting, filtering, and report generation to increase productivity

Demonstrates complete modular application development using C

Strengthens concepts of dynamic memory, data structures, loops, conditionals, and functions

Provides real‑world understanding of task delegation and team coordination

🌟 Key Features

Add new tasks with title, assigned user, priority level, deadline, estimates, and tags

Sort tasks by priority level and deadline using bubble sort and date comparison

Filter tasks based on assigned user or tag

Mark tasks as completed and generate user productivity reports

Dynamic task list storage using malloc() and realloc()

Edit existing tasks and update attributes

Recurring tasks & dependency handling for task linking

Fully menu‑driven interface, easy to navigate and understand

🔧 Technical Concepts Implemented

Concept	Description

Structures (struct)	Multiple custom structures for Task, User & Date
Dynamic Memory	Auto‑expanding task list using malloc() & realloc()
File Handling (Future scope)	Save/load capability can be integrated
Sorting Algorithms	Bubble sort for priority & date sorting
Searching	Search by ID, filter by user & tags
Modularity	Separate functions for each feature
String Handling	Parsing input and tag filtering
Conditional Logic	Status updates & dependency validation

👥 Target Use Cases

Small project teams and student groups

Lightweight productivity tool for task distribution

Demonstration of structured programming concepts in academics

Base for future extension into GUI, file storage, or web-app system

🚀 Expected Outcome

Users understand system design with modular programming

Team members learn to collaborate using Git & GitHub commits

Practical experience with memory management and data handling

Ready‑to‑deploy academic submission with documentation and screenshots
